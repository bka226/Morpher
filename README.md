# Morpher
The goal of this project is to provide a user interface and backend driver that supports the specification and
 rendering of a piecewise (triangular) image morph between twoimages. Once specified, the morphwill be rendered
 as a sequence of images that can be wrapped as a video (mp4, for example)
 and used in standard video editing software.  Your work in this phasewill completethe backend of the framework
 by applying the specified transitions to the underlying target imagesand by adding additional features.
